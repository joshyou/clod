# HBM Price Trends: Current Market and Long-Term Outlook

*Research Report — December 2024*

---

## Executive Summary

High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) is experiencing unprecedented demand driven by AI infrastructure buildouts. Prices jumped over 60% between 2024 and 2025, with supply unable to meet demand through at least 2026. Long-term, prices are expected to decline as capacity expands and manufacturing matures, following the typical semiconductor learning curve—though the timeline remains uncertain.

## Current Market Conditions (2024–2025)

### Price Surge

- HBM prices increased **more than 60%** between 2024 and 2025
- HBM2e costs approximately **5x more per GB** than standard DDR5
- Demand for HBM bits rose nearly **200%** in 2024 alone

### Market Size

- Global HBM market valued at ~$7.3 billion in 2025
- HBM revenue projected to nearly double to **$34 billion** in 2025
- Micron's HBM revenue hit $4.27 billion in Q1 fiscal 2026 (up 5.7x YoY)

### Supply Constraints

The three major producers—**SK hynix (~54% share), Samsung, and Micron**—are operating at full capacity but still cannot meet demand. Key factors:

- HBM consumes **3x the wafer capacity** of standard DDR5 per gigabyte
- Advanced packaging (CoWoS, TSV stacking) creates additional bottlenecks
- Order backlogs have locked in supplier capacity through 2026
- Memory makers have reallocated DDR5 lines to HBM, constraining conventional DRAM supply

## Technology Evolution

| Generation | Capacity/Stack | Bandwidth | Status |
|------------|----------------|-----------|--------|
| HBM2 | 8 GB | 307 GB/s | Mature (50% market share in 2024) |
| HBM2e | 16 GB | 460 GB/s | Current mainstream |
| HBM3 | 24 GB | 819 GB/s | Ramping |
| HBM3E | 36 GB (12-layer) | ~1.2 TB/s | Mass production started Sept 2024 |
| HBM4 | TBD | ~2 TB/s | Standard published April 2025 |

Each generation delivers higher density and bandwidth, but also requires more complex manufacturing—12-layer stacking with through-silicon vias (TSVs) is pushing the limits of current packaging technology.

## Long-Term Price Outlook

### Near-Term (2025–2026): Prices Remain Elevated

- The memory sector appears to be in a **"supercycle"** with elevated prices projected through at least H1 2026
- New fab capacity won't meaningfully arrive until 2027 at the earliest
- Micron is accelerating capex to $20 billion in fiscal 2026, but new Idaho fab won't come online until mid-2027

### Medium-Term (2027–2028): Potential Price Normalization

- Some analysts expect **double-digit HBM price declines in 2026** as yields improve and next-gen capacity ramps
- Micron now projects a $100 billion HBM market by 2028 (accelerated from previous 2030 estimate)
- New fabs coming online: Micron Idaho (mid-2027), Singapore packaging plant (2027), second foundry (end of 2028)

### Theoretical Long-Term Trajectory

Semiconductor memory historically follows a predictable pattern:

1. **Introduction phase**: High prices due to low yields and limited capacity
2. **Growth phase**: Prices decline as yields improve and capacity scales (typically 20–30% annual cost reduction)
3. **Maturity phase**: Commoditization with thin margins

**However, HBM may deviate from this pattern** for several reasons:

- **Inherently more complex manufacturing**: 3D stacking with TSVs is fundamentally harder than planar DRAM
- **Continued demand growth**: AI scaling may outpace supply expansion for years
- **Limited competition**: Only three viable manufacturers, all capacity-constrained
- **Premium positioning**: HBM serves high-margin AI/HPC markets, not consumer devices

**Expected long-term trend**: Prices will decline from current peaks as manufacturing scales, but HBM will likely retain a significant premium over commodity DRAM (perhaps 2–3x rather than 5x) due to its complexity and specialized nature.

## Key Risks to Price Forecasts

| Risk | Direction | Likelihood |
|------|-----------|------------|
| AI demand slows | ↓ Prices | Low-Medium |
| Faster-than-expected capacity ramp | ↓ Prices | Medium |
| New entrants (e.g., Chinese manufacturers) | ↓ Prices | Low (near-term) |
| HBM4 transition delays | ↑ Prices | Medium |
| Packaging bottlenecks persist | ↑ Prices | High |

## Conclusion

HBM prices are at historic highs and will likely remain elevated through 2026 due to severe supply-demand imbalance. Long-term, prices should decline following the semiconductor learning curve, but the rate of decline will be slower than typical commodity DRAM due to manufacturing complexity and sustained AI-driven demand. The market is projected to reach $50–100 billion by 2028–2030, suggesting that even with price declines, total revenue will continue growing rapidly as volume scales.
